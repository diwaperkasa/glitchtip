  <p>
    Events are the unit of measure for tracking GlitchTip usage. An
    organization's maximum number of events per month is determined by its
    subscription type. Events are used to measure four GlitchTip features:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Issues:</b> Each occurrence of an event reported to GlitchTip</li>
    <li>
      <b>Uptime:</b> Whenever GlitchTip checks the status of your app or your
      app sends a request to GlitchTip to report its own status
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Performance:</b> Each time your app sends GlitchTip a transaction
      report for a tracked activity on your app
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Releases:</b> Each megabyte of file storage is counted as an event
    </li>
  </ul>
